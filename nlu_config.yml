# The two most important pipelines are tensorflow_embedding and spacy_sklearn.
# The biggest difference between them is that the spacy_sklearn pipeline uses pre-trained word vectors from either GloVe
# or fastText. Instead, the tensorflow embedding pipeline doesnâ€™t use any pre-trained word vectors, but instead fits
# these specifically for your dataset.
pipeline: spacy_sklearn

# spacy_sklearn pipeline has the following structure
